# ModelSkill Release Webinar - 2024-04-24
Notebooks demonstrating the [ModelSkill](https://github.com/DHI/modelskill) model validation library

Quantitative skill assessment (validation) of a numerical model is important for most modelling projects. But without proper tools, this can be a time-consuming task. That's why DHI developed ModelSkill, an open-source Python library designed to streamline the skill assessment process for any type of model (i.e., MIKE, FEFLOW, WEST, etc.).

This quick-to-install library offers a wide range of common metrics, simplifies data analysis and provides easy access to plots typically used for model validation (time-series, scatter, Q-Q, etc.). Since ModelSkill is built with Python, it is also customisable and extensible, allowing for the unique formatting of plots and domain-specific metrics if necessary.

This webinar will explore the following topics:

• Getting started with ModelSkill

• Running multi-observation-multi-model comparisons with ease

• Assessing the skill on a subset of data efficiently

• Conducting skill assessment by month

• Showcasing model validation from various domains
